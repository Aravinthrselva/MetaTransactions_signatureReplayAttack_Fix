/**
 * 
 * 
 * After the initial 'infinite approval', 
 * the sender was able to transfer 10 tokens to the recipient without needing to pay gas themselves.
 * You can extend this test further easily to see that this would even work for multiple transfers, 
 *  as long as you don't exceed the user's balance of 10,000 tokens.
 * 
 * ðŸ”“ Security Vulnerability
 * 
 * Since the signature contains the information necessary, 
 * the relayer could keep sending the signature to the contract over and over, 
 * thereby continuously transferring tokens out of the sender's account into the recipient's account.
 * until the user would lose all their tokens!
 * 
 * - This attack is called SIGNATURE REPLAY
 * 
 * Instead, the transaction should only be executed when the user explicitly provides a second signature
 
************************************************************************************************************* 
  To avoid this, we introduce a fifth parameter, the nonce.

The nonce is just a random number value, and can be selected by the user, the contract, be randomly generated, 
it doesn't matter - - as long as the user's signature includes that nonce
Since the exact same transaction but with a different nonce would produce a different signature, 
the above problem is solved!

CODE IMPLEMENTATIONS


1. add a mapping(bytes32 => bool) 
to keep track of which signatures have already been executed.

2. update the helper function getHash to take in a nonce parameter and include that in the hash.

3. update the transfer function to also take in the nonce and pass it onto getHash when verifying the signature. 

4. It will also update the mapping to true AFTER the signature is verified.


----TEST SCENARIO ------

The first test here has the user sign two distinct signatures with two distinct nonces,
 and the relayer executes them both. 
 
 In the second test, however, the relayer attempts to execute the same signature twice. 
The second time the relayer tries to use the same signature, we expect the transaction to revert.

This shows that signature replay can no longer happen, and the vulnerability is secured!
