/**
 * 
 * 
 * After the initial 'infinite approval', 
 * the sender was able to transfer 10 tokens to the recipient without needing to pay gas themselves.
 * You can extend this test further easily to see that this would even work for multiple transfers, 
 *  as long as you don't exceed the user's balance of 10,000 tokens.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ðŸ”“ Security Vulnerability
 * 
 * Since the signature contains the information necessary, 
 * the relayer could keep sending the signature to the contract over and over, 
 * thereby continuously transferring tokens out of the sender's account into the recipient's account.
 * until the user would lose all their tokens!
 * 
 * - This attack is called SIGNATURE REPLAY
 * 
 * Instead, the transaction should only be executed when the user explicitly provides a second signature
